# C4_Comets_Bardan_Irina

This repository contains my **laboratory assignments** for the **Solana Blockchain Developer Program (C4)**.  
It is a hands-on workspace where I practice and document the fundamentals of **Web3, Blockchain, and Solana development**.  

---

## Theoretical Topics Covered (+ what I searched online)
Laboratory 1 - EC25519, clusters on Solana, environments (devnet, Testnet, ...), Elliptic Curve cryptography, System Program, Executable Flag, Program (Solana), PDA (Program Derived Address), DAO, CU, Web3

## Purpose 
This repo serves as both:
- A **learning log** for my Solana journey  
- A **workspace** for experimenting with smart contracts, wallets and programs

## Recommendation
If you are reading this and are someone interested in learning **blockchain development** and especially **Solana**,  
I highly recommend joining the free **Solana Developer Program** by Comets of Web3
Itâ€™s a great way to gain both theoretical knowledge and practical experience and you also get to participate in hackatons!
